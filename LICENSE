2.2 Server Use and Monetization  
Operate servers that use the Project and engage in Server Monetization, provided that:  
(a) You do not sell, rent, or license the Project itself as a separate product; and  
(b) You do not represent the Project as Your own work or as an official version endorsed by the copyright holder.

(b) this license is included unmodified in the Modpack;

Any such Derivative Works may only be distributed to the extent strictly necessary to test or submit contributions to the original Project and may not be publicly released as a separate project without the copyright holder's prior written permission.

3. Restrictions

Except as expressly permitted in Section 2, You may NOT:

3.1 Commercial Distribution

(b) selling Modpacks in which the Project is a component;  
(c) including the Project in any paid software bundle, subscription, or similar commercial product.

Operating monetized servers in accordance with Section 2.2 is permitted and does not, by itself, constitute commercial distribution of the Project.

3.4 Misrepresentation  
Misrepresent the origin of the Project or any Derivative Work, or falsely claim authorship, endorsement, or official status by the copyright holder.

5. Termination
