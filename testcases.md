# Test Scenarios

## Tidal Guardians Gateway
- Place and activate the crafted gate pearl to ensure the `kubejs:tidal_guardians` gateway (from `data/kubejs/gateways/gateways/tidal_guardians.json`) appears with the teal frame and medium footprint.
- Verify the first four waves spawn 4/5/6/7 Guardians respectively with progressively higher survivability and damage; confirm timers respect the configured setup/max durations.
- Confirm the fifth wave spawns exactly one Elder Guardian and that its boosted health, armor, knockback resistance, and damage output are noticeable compared to vanilla.
- After clearing the event, ensure rewards include multiple Guardian/Elder Guardian loot rolls plus the warm ocean ruin loot-table drop.
